<h1>Proteins as the bottlenecks in drug discovery</h1>

<p>
Evolution has provided biology with just twenty canonical amino acids, yet from this limited alphabet emerges the full diversity of protein structures and functions found in nature. This constraint is not merely a biochemical curiosity — it defines the boundaries of what has historically been considered “druggable”.
</p>

<p>
A large fraction of therapeutically relevant targets are proteins whose biological properties challenge classical drug discovery long before medicinal chemistry begins.
</p>

<h2>Where the problem starts: before chemistry</h2>

<p>
Many therapeutically relevant targets are membrane proteins operating at the interface between aqueous and lipid environments. Their biological function depends on specific lipid contexts, conformational dynamics, and transient states that are difficult to preserve during expression, purification, and structural characterization.
</p>

<p>
As a result, the protein used for biochemical assays or structural studies often fails to reflect its biologically relevant form. In such cases, failure occurs upstream of chemistry — at the level of target definition and biophysical reality.
</p>

<h2>Beyond membranes: undruggable soluble proteins</h2>

<p>
Beyond membranes, numerous disease-driving proteins remain elusive due to extensive intrinsic disorder, transient interaction surfaces, or the absence of stable binding pockets. These properties challenge classical structure-based drug discovery not because chemistry is insufficient, but because the biological target itself resists stable engagement.
</p>

<p>
Together, membrane proteins and intrinsically disordered regions expose a fundamental limitation of traditional therapeutic strategies.
</p>

<h2>Expanding the druggable proteome</h2>

<p>
Understanding why certain proteins remain undruggable reframes the problem from technical inadequacy to biological reality. Advances in de novo protein design now enable the engineering of synthetic binders and scaffolds capable of stabilizing specific conformations, engaging dynamic interfaces, and accessing membrane-embedded targets.
</p>

<p>
In doing so, these approaches expand the druggable proteome beyond what evolution optimized for natural function rather than therapeutic intervention.
