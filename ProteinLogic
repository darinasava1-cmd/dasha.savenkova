How protein biology shapes drug discovery

ProteinLogic is a personal science platform focused on understanding protein biology
behind therapeutic success and failure.

I explore why certain proteins — especially membrane and structurally complex targets —
remain difficult to drug, where translation from hypothesis to therapy breaks,
and how biological reality shapes decision-making in early drug discovery.

This site is for scientists, biotech professionals, and anyone interested in 
how deep protein biology informs translational research and therapeutic strategy.
