## Proteins as the bottlenecks in drug discovery

Evolution has provided biology with just twenty canonical amino acids, yet from this limited alphabet emerges the full diversity of protein structures and functions found in nature. This constraint is not merely a biochemical curiosity — it defines the boundaries of what has historically been considered “druggable”.

A large fraction of therapeutically relevant targets are proteins whose biological properties challenge classical drug discovery long before medicinal chemistry begins. Many of these targets are membrane proteins, operating at the interface between aqueous and lipid environments. Their function depends on specific lipid contexts, conformational dynamics, and transient states that are difficult to preserve during expression, purification, and structural characterization. As a result, the protein used for assays or structure determination often fails to reflect its biologically relevant form.

Beyond membranes, numerous disease-driving proteins remain elusive due to extensive intrinsic disorder, transient interaction surfaces, or the absence of stable binding pockets. In these cases, the difficulty lies not in optimizing small molecules, but in defining a target that can be meaningfully engaged in the first place.

Together, membrane proteins and intrinsically disordered regions reveal a fundamental limitation of classical structure-based drug discovery. Failure frequently occurs upstream of chemistry — at the level of target definition, biophysical stability, conformational heterogeneity, and biological context.

Understanding why certain proteins remain undruggable reframes the problem from technical inadequacy to biological reality. Advances in de novo protein design now enable the engineering of synthetic binders and scaffolds capable of stabilizing specific conformations, engaging dynamic interfaces, and accessing membrane-embedded targets. In doing so, they expand the druggable proteome beyond what evolution optimized for natural function rather than therapeutic intervention.
